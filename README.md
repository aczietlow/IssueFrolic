# Issue Frolic

Tiptoe through the tulips that are gitHub issues.

A tool to let users explore, search, create, read, update, and close GitHub issues from the command line. 

## Why

Shits and Giggles, per normal

Heavily inspired and borrowed from an exercise from "The GO Programming Language" by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan
